    <h2>Weather pro (2020-2021/university)</h2>
    <p>
      This application allowed us to present the different times
      weather during a day. But with the help of the django rest
      framework, we were able to use the api providing this
      information and publish it on our application with further
      enhancements. We used Vue.js for the frontend. For my part,
      I had to help set up the backend.

    <h2>Child care location (2020-2021/university)</h2>
    <p>
      A university application project, enabling parents to keep
      track of their children. I took part in this university project
      with my colleagues and was responsible for setting up the
      UML and BPMN architecture. I also took part in
      implementing the backend, which we built using python
      django rest framework and mysql as the database. Once
      implemented, we hosted it in the cloud using AWS services.

        wroclawska university to determine the time of day when
        students log on most. And finally to predict solutions for
        improving the internet network.
